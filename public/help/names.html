    <h2>name</h2>

    <p>
      Names may be any of a variety commonly used. Thus the net with
      symbol <b>srs</b> is often called SrSi<sub>2</sub> or
      (10-3)-a; <b>cab</b> is CaB<sub>6</sub>. Mineral names are often used
      for nets of either the underlying framework (quartz, feldspar) or the
      entire structure (rutile, pyrite). Obviously it is not desirable to have
      a proliferation of names, so not all names that are known by the
      database are shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some structures we also give the Fischer symbol as a name. These
      symbols apply to vertex-transitive sphere packings and are of the sort
      <i>p</i>/<i>q</i>/<i>rn</i> where <i>p</i> is the coordination
      number, <i>q</i> is the smallest ring size, <i>r</i> is a symbol for the
      crystal system (<i>c</i> = cubic, <i>t</i> = tetragonal, <i>h</i> =
      hexagonal) and <i>n</i> is a serial number for given <i>pqr</i>. See
      the <a href="/about.html" target="_blank">About</a> page for
      references to Fischer's work.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following symbols are for coordination figures:
    </p>

    <p>
      3 triangle</br>
      S square</br>
      T tetrahedron</br>
      O octahedron</br>
      P trigonal prism</br>
      H hexagon</br>
      C cube</br>
      X hexagonal prism</br>
      B cuboctahedron</br>
    </p>

    <p>
      One may search for nets with approximately regular coordination figures
      A and B for bipartite nets (AB with B linked only to A and A linked only
      to B) by entering names with the name “AB net” where A and B are one of
      the above symbols for coordination figure (e.g.3T net or ST net).
      Three-symbol sequences are also possible as in “3ST net”.  Coordination
      symbols must be in the above order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Names also function as specialized keywords. For example one may find
      tilings with certain large (20 or more faces) tiles by entering a
      "name": (these “names” generally don’t appear on the page of the net).

      Other special "names":
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>carbon</dt>
      <dd>
        retrieves 3-coordinated nets that are carried by tilings of the P, D
        or G minimal surfaces.
      </dd>

      <dt>silica</dt>
      <dd>
        retrieves nets of known tectosilicates (such as coesite, feldspar) and
        related tetrahedral nets (e.g. that of CaGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)
        other than recognized zeolite nets.
      </dd>

      <dt>square</dt>
      <dd>
        retrieves 4-coordinated nets with square coordination of all vertices.
      </dd>

      <dt><b>xyz</b>-derived</dt>
      <dd>
        gives nets derived from <b>xyz</b> by splitting some vertices into
        combinations of lower coordination. For example <b>tfa</b> is derived
        from <b>dia</b> by splitting half the tetrahedral vertices into pairs
        of triangular ones and is retrieved by the name "dia-derived".
