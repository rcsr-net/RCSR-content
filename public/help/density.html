    <h2>density</h2>

    <p>
      Almost all nets are given as embeddings with all edge lengths equal to
      unity. The volume is then maximized subject to that constraint. The
      density is the number of vertices per unit volume.
    </p>

    <p>
      For structures in which the edge lengths are the shortest inter-vertex
      distances, i.e. sphere packings, the fraction of space filled by equal
      spheres in contact is the density multiplied by &pi;/6 = 0.5236.
