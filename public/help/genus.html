    <h2>genus</h2>

    <p>
      The genus of a net is here defined as follows. Imagine the net to be
      composed of edges of finite width. Take a primitive cell and join edges
      going in the + [uvw] direction to their partners in the -[uvw]
      direction. One then obtains a &quot;handlebody&quot; with n handles. n
      is the genus. For a 3-periodic net the genus must be greater than or
      equal to 3. <i>Minimal nets</i> (Beukeman, A; Klee,
      W. E., <i>Z. Kristallogr.</i> <b>1992</b>, <i>201</i>, 37-51) have genus
      = 3. If there are <i>v</i> vertices and <i>e</i> edges per unit cell
      then the genus is 1 + <i>e</i> - <i>v.</i>  (The genus is the cyclomatic
      number of the quotient graph, see the cited reference.)
    </p>

    <p>
      A useful observation is that the genus of the net of a tiling is equal
      to the genus of the net of the dual tiling. (If the tiling has <i>f</i>
      faces and <i>p</i> tiles, the net of the dual tiling has genus 1
      + <i>f</i> - <i>p</i>.  But for a tiling <i>v</i> - <i>e</i> + <i>f</i>
      - <i>p</i> = 0. See e.g Coxeter, H. S.  M. <i>Regular Polytopes</i> 3rd
      ed.  Dover, New York 1973. page 172).

      <span style='color:red'><b>Warning.</b></span>  In graph theory the
      genus of a finite graph is quite different. It is the minimum number of
      handles that must be added to the plane to allow an embedding of the
      graph without any edge intersections. Using this definition, the genus
      of any plane graph is zero. However using our definition given above,
      the genus of a periodic net that is the labyrinth system of a periodic
      minimal (or other) surface, is the same as that of the surface
      itself. In this last connection see Fischer, W.; Koch, E. Genera of
      minimal balance surfaces. Acta Crystallogr. <b>1989</b>, <i>A45</i>,
      726-732.
