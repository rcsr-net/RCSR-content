      The basic structures have a three-letter code e.g. <b>srs</b> for the
      SrSi<sub>2</sub> net and <b>dia</b> for the diamond net.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some derived structures are designated thus (see below for definitions)

    <dl>
      <dt>augmented net</dt>
      <dd>
        is one in which the vertices of the original net are replaced by a
        polygon or polyhedron corresponding to the original coordination
        figure. The net (<b>cab</b>) named for CaB<sub>6</sub> is the
        augmented primitive cubic (<b>pcu</b>) net and can also be found using
        the symbol <b>pcu-a</b>.
      </dd>

      <dt>binary net</dt>
      <dd>
        is one derived from a uninodal net with even rings by alternating
        vertices <i>AB</i> such that <i>A</i> is bonded only to <i>B</i> and
        vice versa. The sphalerite structure of ZnS is the binary version of
        diamond (<b>dia-b</b>). A binary net can have one kind of vertex
        colored as in <b>tbo-b</b> or even one kind of node three-colored as
        in <b>tbo-b3</b>. Yet another possibility is that a uninodal net may
        have the nodes split into unequal parts as in <b>srs‑b*</b> in which ¼
        of the nodes are one color and ¾ another color (the net is no longer
        bipartite now).
      </dd>

      <dt>catenated net</dt>
      <dd>
        refers to a pair of self-dual nets (such as diamond)
        intergrown. Notice that the symmetry of the pair is different from
        that of just one. Multiple (<i>n</i>-fold) catenations are indicated
        by extension <b>‑c<i>n</i></b>. There may be two different catenations
        of the same multiplicity as in <b>dia-c3</b> and <b>dia-c3*</b>.
      </dd>

      <dt>dual net</dt>
      <dd>
        is the net of the tiling dual the natural tiling of the first
        net. This is the same net in the case of self-dual
        nets. E.g. <b>dia-d</b> = <b>dia</b>.
      </dd>

      <dt>edge net</dt>
      <dd>
        (also expanded net) is obtained from the original net by placing
        vertices in the middle of the edges, discarding the original vertices
        and edges, and joining the new vertices to enclose the coordination
        figure of the original vertices.
      </dd>

      <dt>decorated nets</dt>
      <dd>
        are obtained by replacing the vertices of the original net by groups
        of vertices. Augmented nets are special cases of decorated nets. (To
        see examples enter <b>bcu</b>.)
      </dd>

      <dt>extended coordination</dt>
      <dd>
        Occasionally one wants to consider other than nearest neighbors in the
        coordination shell. An example is provided by the body-centered cubic
        lattice. Each vertex has eight first neighbors and 6 second
        neighbors. The structure <b>bcu</b> is eight-coordinated and is the
        dual of <b>nbo</b>. <b>bcu-x</b> is 14-coordinated and is the dual
        of <b>sod</b>. [<b>bcu-x</b> is the structure corresponding to a
        vertex- and tile-transitive tiling of space by tetrahedra].
      </dd>

      <dt>alternative configuration</dt>
      <dd>
        Sometimes a configuration other than the maximum volume is of
        interest. See for example the configuration (<b>ths-z</b>) of the
        3-coordinated <b>ths</b> net with the three edges meeting at a vertex
        forming a T shape. In nets such as <b>sld-z</b> and <b>rld-z</b> in
        the maximum symmetry configuration two or more vertices occupy the
        same site. For such nets the embed type is given as 5 followed by the
        symbol for the maximum-symmetry space group.
