    <h2>keywords</h2>

    <p>These are mainly self-explanatory, but note</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>uniform</dt>
      <dd>
        Tilings by regular polygons. Sometimes one sees k-uniform for k-nodal
        tilings by regular polygons.
      </dd>

      <dt>circle packing</dt>
      <dd>
        These are tilings that have embeddings with equal edges that
        correspond to the shortest distance between vertices.
      </dd>

      <dt>weaving</dt>
      <dd>
        These patterns appear if, and only if, the keyword and/or symbol are
        checked. For weaving of threads (coordination number given as 2) the
        “vertices” are crossing points. For interwoven 2-periodic nets
        (e.g. sql) the coordinates of the vertices are given.

        <p>
          The main information is the symmetry which is that of one of the 80
          layer groups.
