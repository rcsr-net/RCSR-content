    <h2>td10</h2>

    <p>
      td10 is the cumulative sum of the first 10 shells of topological
      neighbors (i.e. the first 10 terms of the coordination sequence). For
      structures with more than one kind of vertex the value given is a
      weighted average over the vertices. Related nets usually have similar
      values of td10, so this is a good way to find related nets of the same
      coordination number. Note that, by convention, the coordination sequence
      starts with 1 for the reference vertex (shell 0) and this is included in
      the cumulative total given for each vertex.
