    <h2>D-size</h2>

    <p>
      D is short for what is usually called the Delaney symbol or
      Delaney-Dress symbol or the Delaney-Dress-Delgado symbol, that is used
      to encode the topology of a tiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The size is the number of distinct (not symmetry-related) chambers in
      the tiling, and is the same as the <i>flag
      transitivity</i>. A <i>regular tiling</i> has D-size of 1 (check what
      tilings are regular).  See also the meaning of <i>regular net</i>
      under <a href="/help/keywords.html" target="_blank">keywords</a>.
