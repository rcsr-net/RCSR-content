    The most important part is a searchable database of 3-periodic nets. These
    are presented for the most part in maximum symmetry embeddings in which
    edge lengths are constrained to be equal to unity and the volume is
    maximized subject to that constraint. For these the "embed type" is
    1. Some nets do not allow such embeddings and other embeddability types
    are given below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clicking the "nets" link leads to a search page where searches can be done
    by <i>symbol</i> (every structure in this database has a unique symbol),
    by <i>name</i> (some structures have names), by <i>keyword</i> and
    by <i>properties</i>. Searches are not cases sensitive.
    The terms are all explained in pages accessed by
    clicking the appropriate link on the search page. As well as
    crystallographic data, vertex symbols and coordination sequences are
    given. For an explanation of these see reference [1] below. Tilings are
    generally given as natural tilings [2] with face symbols
    [<i>N<sup>n</sup></i>.<i>M<sup>m</sup></i>...] that indicate that the tile
    has <i>n N-</i>sided faces, <i>m M</i>-sided faces etc. For other terms
    see the links on the search page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other databases are of 2-periodic structures ("layers") and of
    "polyhedra". At present we have fewer entries for these. Users familiar
    with the "nets" search should find these self-explanatory, but read on
    after "embeddings" on how to use the coordinate data for polyhedra and
    some other notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The symbol is either a three-letter symbol <b>pqr</b> or a three letter
    symbol with an extension as in <b>pqr-a</b>. It is not necessary to know
    the meanings of the extensions but it can be useful, and clicking on the
    "symbol" link on the "nets" search page will provide an explanation of the
    extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Much of the data (structures with embed type not 1) have been entered by
    hand, so there doubtlessly are errors; please let us know if you identify
    any.
  </p>

  <p>
    The structures are nets (special kinds of graphs) and to use the data one
    needs to know the edges ("bonds"). For "embed type" 1 (most of the data)
    the shortest distances are the edges. For other structures it is generally
    sufficient to put a vertex of valence 2 at the midpoints of the edges
    (these data are given). Structures where this won't work (one has to
    explicitly use the symmetry) include <b>elv</b>, <b>mab</b>, <b>tcb</b>,
    <b>tcc</b>, <b>ten</b>.

  <h2>
    Embeddings of nets <sup>[10]</sup>
  </h2>

  <p>
    Usually in describing a net, parameters are given appropriate to a
    maximum-symmetry embedding. For space groups with two origins in the
    International Tables we always use the second one (origin at a center od
    symmetry).
    Ideally also the shortest distances are all
    equal (for convenience unity in the units of the lattice parameters) and
    correspond to the edges of the net. This ideal situation is not always
    possible however, as can seen by considering a generic infinite net
    without symmetry. Let the average coordination number be <i>Z</i>, then
    there are <i>Z</i>/2 edges per vertex.  Each vertex has three coordinates
    (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>), so if <i>Z</i> &gt; 6 there are more
    constraints (edge lengths) than degrees of freedom (coordinates) and there
    is no solution for equal edges possible. In fact, as the equations for
    edge lengths are non-linear in coordinates, there is no guarantee that
    there is a solution even for <i>Z</i> &lt;= 6. Of course we are not
    dealing with generic structures, but rather with translational and,
    usually, other symmetries, so the problem is quite complicated. There are
    several cases to consider:
  </p>

  <ol type="1">
    <li>
      For the simple nets most common in crystal chemistry the
      maximum symmetry embedding is a sphere packing. There are three
      cases:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          The coordinates and unit cell shape are fixed by symmetry in the
          maximum-symmetry embedding.
        </li>

        <li>
          In other cases there are still degrees of freedom remaining. It is
          common in this case to report a structure that is a minimum of density
          (maximum cell volume) subject to the constraint of equal edge lengths
          which can be taken as unity.
        </li>

        <li>
          Again there are free parameters, but the minimum density configuration
          corresponds to a structure with more contacts.  This is almost the
          same as 2a (not exactly as minimum density may not be maximum
          symmetry).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      The maximum symmetry embedding corresponds to a sphere packing with more
      contacts than the coordination number, <i>n</i>, but <i>n</i> of those
      contacts correspond to edges; there are two cases:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          There is an embedding as an <i>n</i>-coordinated sphere packing of
          lower symmetry in which the <i>n</i> edges correspond to edges.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is not an embedding as above (strictly we should say that such
          an embedding cannot be found, <i>proving</i> one does not exist
          might be difficult). This case is more common than might be
          supposed.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      The maximum symmetry embedding is a sphere packing with fewer contacts
      than the coordination number, <i>n</i>; but the <i>n</i> shortest
      distances correspond to the edges of the <i>n</i>-coordinated net; there
      are three cases:

      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          There is a lower-symmetry embedding with equal edge lengths and
          edges still corresponding to shortest distances between
          vertices.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is no embedding with equal edge lengths.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is an embedding with shortest distances equal to edges, but
          they cannot all be made equal and remain shortest
          distances.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      There is no embedding with shortest distances corresponding to
      edges. This is in fact the case for the vast majority of nets. Until
      recently they were not recognized in crystal chemistry, as normally
      bonds (corresponding to edges of nets) are formed to nearest neighbors,
      but, with flexible linkers instead of bonds as the edges of nets, they
      are beginning to appear (see e.g. <b>tcb</b>). Most catenated nets (see
      e.g. <b>pcu-c</b>) are like this.
    </li>

    <li>
      There may be no faithful embedding in the maximum symmetry conformation
      because the symmetry will require edges to intersect. There is always a
      lower-symmetry embedding - all graphs have a faithful embedding in
      3-dimensional Euclidean space. These lower symmetry embeddings may be
      any one of the types described above in 1-4 (but of course not of
      maximum symmetry), and there may be several equally "good". These
      structures can be recognized by the fact that: (a) They have
      symbol <b>abc-z</b> and there is no entry <b>abc</b>. (b) They have
      embed type 5. The maximum symmetry for these nets is given in the same
      box as the embed type.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Collisions</h2>

  <p>
    In computing properties of nets, for example in the program
    <b>Systre</b>, it is convenient to use center-of-mass (barycentric)
    coordinates (all vertices assigned the same mass - see reference [4]). For
    some exceptional structures one may find that two vertices then have
    identical coordinates. Such structures are identified by an asterisk in
    the embed type (e.g. *1b). <b>Systre</b> won't always recognize these
    structures. <b>Systre</b> can be obtained
    from <a href="http://gavrog.org">gavrog.org</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Density</h2>

  <p>
    The density is the number of vertices per unit volume for the given
    embedding. For structures of embed, type 1 or 2 (all edges of equal length
    and no shorter intervertex distance shorter) on can calculate the
    space-filling fraction of equal spheres in contact for that structure by
    multiplying the density by &pi;/6.
  </p>

  <h2>Genus</h2>

  <p>
    A net can be considered a periodic surface of genus <i>g</i> if one
    imagines the edges inflated to have finite width. If there are <i>e</i>
    edges and <i>v</i> vertices in the primitive cell then <i>g</i> = 1
    + <i>e</i> - <i>v</i>. See the link for "density" on the search page.
  </p>

  <h2>Tiling data</h2>

  <p>
    Data for tilings are for the so-called "natural" tilings (reference [2]
    and [13]).  The D-symbols are what were originally called "Delaney"
    symbols by Dress and "Delaney-Dress" symbols by subsequent workers. The
    economical one-line encoding is due to Delgado-Friedrichs so "D-symbol"
    seems appropriate. The size of the D-symbol is what is known as "flag
    transitivity" to mathematicians. One may use the search to find the only
    regular tiling (D-symbol size = 1) and all natural tilings with size up to
    4. Regular <i>nets</i> are defined independently of tilings but are the
    only structures with natural tilings that have one kind of vertex, edge,
    face and tile (transitivity 1111 - see reference [2]).
  </p>

  <h2>Layers and polyhedra</h2>

  <p>
    <i>Layers</i> are three dimensional 2-periodic structures and their
    symmetries are layer groups. Strictly 2-dimensional 2-periodic structures
    have symmetries that are plane groups.  Structures that are not
    2-dimensional have the keyword "layer" We give also a 3-dimensional space
    group which can be used for entering the structure in a crystal-drawing
    program such as CrystalMaker. Where possible, coordinates are given for
    unit edge length.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that for 2-dimensional structures, vertex symbols denote the
    polygons meeting at that vertex in cyclic order (compare 3^3.4^2 and
    3^2.4.3.4); for layers vertex symbols are the same as for nets.
  </p>

  <p>
    See reference [12] below for an account of plane nets in crystal
    chemistry. For nets named OKHnn, nn is the net number of that
    work.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Polyhedra</i> are 0-periodic, but of course 3-dimensional.  We use the
    term to include generalized polyhedra ("cages") such as the adamantane
    cage (see <b>ada</b>). The coordinates of the vertices are cartesian
    coordinates but can be used with the given space group to again draw as if
    it were part of a crystal structure. To do this set the unit cell of the
    given space group to <i>d d d</i> 90.0 90.0 90.0 with <i>d</i> some
    convenient number (say 10.0) and divide the given coordinates by <i>d</i>
    and use them as crystal coordinates. One will then get the polyhedron
    centered on 0, 0, 0.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that for polyhedra with non-crystallographic symmetries more than
    one set of coordinates may be given for a single vertex type - see
    e.g. <b>dod</b> with icosahedral symmetry but described with <i>m</i>-3
    symmetry - the single vertex type splits into V1a and V1b.  Hexagonal
    polyhedra are described using an orthorhombic space group - see
    e.g. <b>hxb</b>. A square antiprism is another example of a polyhedron
    with non-crystallographic symmetry - see <b>sap</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For convenience the coordinates of the centers of faces are also
    given.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the strict definition adopted by many mathematicians
    <i>polyhedra</i> have a planar 3-connected graph and can be realized as a
    strictly convex solid. We refer to structures that do not have this
    property as <i>cages</i> for the purpose of the database (generally
    elsewhere the term "cage" includes polyhedra as in "sodalite cage" or
    "faujasite cage", but these structures are polyhedra <i>sensu
    stricto</i>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that generally we give vertices for equal edge; some polyhedra do
    not then have planar faces (see e.g. the faujasite cage
    <b>fac</b> which is given as it appears in the crystal structure). For
    <i>Archimedean</i> polyhedra (one kind of vertex) and the full symmetry
    the requirement of equal edges uniquely defines the embedding; for their
    duals (<i>Catalan</i> polyhedra with one kind of face) there are generally
    more degrees of freedom and there appears to be no definitive embedding
    agreed upon - the most pleasing have unequal edges. [Exceptions
    are <b>rdo</b> and <b>trc</b> which are the duals of the two quasiregular
    (one kind of edge) Archimedean polyhedra <b>cbo</b> and <b>ido</b>]
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Simple</i> polyhedra have exactly three faces meeting at a
    vertex; <i>simplicial</i> polyhedra have all triangular faces. The dual of
    a simple polyhedron is simplicial and <i>vice versa</i>.
  </p>
