It is a collection of structures that consist of points (vertices) embedded in
space that are joined by straight non-intersecting links (edges) &mdash; in
mathematical jargon "piecewise linear". A reorganization in 2020 divides these
into four sections: 3-, 2-, 1-, or 0-periodic. These in turn are divided into
two subsets. A default set and a second accessed if, and only if, keyword
"weaving" is selected. Specifically:

<dt>0-periodic.</dt>
<dd>
  <i>Default.</i> Convex polyhedra including a few "cages" with 2-coordinated
  vertices.<br>

  <i>Weaving.</i> Knots, polycatenanes, "tangled" polyhedra (think of Escher's
  cube).
</dd>

<dt>1-periodic.</dt>
<dd>
  <i>Default.</i> Cylinder tilings.<br>

  <i>Weaving.</i> Interlocked components not lined by edges.  Bundles of
  threads (braids), chains etc.
</dd>

<dt>2-periodic.</dt>
<dd>
  <i>Default.</i> Plane tilings (carry 2-periodic graphs).<br>
  <i>Weaving.</i> Interlocked components not linked by edges.  Weavings of
  threads, polycatenanes (chain mail), weaving (interpenetrating) of nets.
</dd>

<dt>3-periodic.</dt>
<dd>
  <i>Default.</i> This is the bulk of RCSR. It contains embeddings of
  3-periodic graphs.  The coordinates are, as far as possible, for equal edge
  lengths and minimum density.<br>

  <i>Weaving.</i> Multi-component 3-periodic structures. Weaving of threads,
  polycatenanes and interpenetrating nets. The last can be deselected in the
  search box by selecting "exclude catenated".
</dd>

<p>
  The symbol is either a three-letter symbol <b>pqr</b> or a three letter
  symbol with an extension as in <b>pqr-a</b>. It is not necessary to know
  the meanings of the extensions but it can be useful, and clicking on the
  "symbol" link on the "nets" search page will provide an explanation of the
  extensions.
</p>

<p>
  Much of the data (structures with embed type not 1) have been entered by
  hand, so there doubtlessly are errors; please let us know if you identify
  any.
</p>

<p>
  The structures are nets (special kinds of graphs) and to use the data one
  needs to know the edges ("bonds"). For "embed type" 1 (most of the data)
  the shortest distances are the edges. For other structures it is generally
  sufficient to put a vertex of valence 2 at the midpoints of the edges
  (these data are given). Structures where this won't work (one has to
  explicitly use the symmetry) include <b>elv</b>, <b>mab</b>, <b>tcb</b>,
  <b>tcc</b>, <b>ten</b>.

<h2>
  Embeddings of nets <sup>[10]</sup>
</h2>

<p>
  Usually in describing a net, parameters are given appropriate to a
  maximum-symmetry embedding. For space groups with two origins in the
  International Tables we always use the second one (origin at a center od
  symmetry).
  Ideally also the shortest distances are all
  equal (for convenience unity in the units of the lattice parameters) and
  correspond to the edges of the net. This ideal situation is not always
  possible however, as can seen by considering a generic infinite net
  without symmetry. Let the average coordination number be <i>Z</i>, then
  there are <i>Z</i>/2 edges per vertex.  Each vertex has three coordinates
  (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>), so if <i>Z</i> &gt; 6 there are more
  constraints (edge lengths) than degrees of freedom (coordinates) and there
  is no solution for equal edges possible. In fact, as the equations for
  edge lengths are non-linear in coordinates, there is no guarantee that
  there is a solution even for <i>Z</i> &lt;= 6. Of course we are not
  dealing with generic structures, but rather with translational and,
  usually, other symmetries, so the problem is quite complicated. There are
  several cases to consider:
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    For the simple nets most common in crystal chemistry the
    maximum symmetry embedding is a sphere packing. There are three
    cases:

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        The coordinates and unit cell shape are fixed by symmetry in the
        maximum-symmetry embedding.
      </li>

      <li>
        In other cases there are still degrees of freedom remaining. It is
        common in this case to report a structure that is a minimum of density
        (maximum cell volume) subject to the constraint of equal edge lengths
        which can be taken as unity.
      </li>

      <li>
        Again there are free parameters, but the minimum density configuration
        corresponds to a structure with more contacts.  This is almost the
        same as 2a (not exactly as minimum density may not be maximum
        symmetry).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    The maximum symmetry embedding corresponds to a sphere packing with more
    contacts than the coordination number, <i>n</i>, but <i>n</i> of those
    contacts correspond to edges; there are two cases:

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        There is an embedding as an <i>n</i>-coordinated sphere packing of
        lower symmetry in which the <i>n</i> edges correspond to edges.
      </li>

      <li>
        There is not an embedding as above (strictly we should say that such
        an embedding cannot be found, <i>proving</i> one does not exist
        might be difficult). This case is more common than might be
        supposed.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    The maximum symmetry embedding is a sphere packing with fewer contacts
    than the coordination number, <i>n</i>; but the <i>n</i> shortest
    distances correspond to the edges of the <i>n</i>-coordinated net; there
    are three cases:

    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        There is a lower-symmetry embedding with equal edge lengths and
        edges still corresponding to shortest distances between
        vertices.
      </li>

      <li>
        There is no embedding with equal edge lengths.
      </li>

      <li>
        There is an embedding with shortest distances equal to edges, but
        they cannot all be made equal and remain shortest
        distances.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    There is no embedding with shortest distances corresponding to
    edges. This is in fact the case for the vast majority of nets. Until
    recently they were not recognized in crystal chemistry, as normally
    bonds (corresponding to edges of nets) are formed to nearest neighbors,
    but, with flexible linkers instead of bonds as the edges of nets, they
    are beginning to appear (see e.g. <b>tcb</b>). Most catenated nets (see
    e.g. <b>pcu-c</b>) are like this.
  </li>

  <li>
    There may be no faithful embedding in the maximum symmetry conformation
    because the symmetry will require edges to intersect. There is always a
    lower-symmetry embedding - all graphs have a faithful embedding in
    3-dimensional Euclidean space. These lower symmetry embeddings may be
    any one of the types described above in 1-4 (but of course not of
    maximum symmetry), and there may be several equally "good". These
    structures can be recognized by the fact that: (a) They have
    symbol <b>abc-z</b> and there is no entry <b>abc</b>. (b) They have
    embed type 5. The maximum symmetry for these nets is given in the same
    box as the embed type.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Collisions</h2>

<p>
  In computing properties of nets, for example in the program
  <b>Systre</b>, it is convenient to use center-of-mass (barycentric)
  coordinates (all vertices assigned the same mass - see reference [4]). For
  some exceptional structures one may find that two vertices then have
  identical coordinates. Such structures are identified by an asterisk in
  the embed type (e.g. *1b). <b>Systre</b> won't always recognize these
  structures. <b>Systre</b> can be obtained
  from <a href="http://gavrog.org">gavrog.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>Density</h2>

<p>
  The density is the number of vertices per unit volume for the given
  embedding. For structures of embed, type 1 or 2 (all edges of equal length
  and no shorter intervertex distance shorter) on can calculate the
  space-filling fraction of equal spheres in contact for that structure by
  multiplying the density by &pi;/6.
</p>

<h2>Genus</h2>

<p>
  A net can be considered a periodic surface of genus <i>g</i> if one
  imagines the edges inflated to have finite width. If there are <i>e</i>
  edges and <i>v</i> vertices in the primitive cell then <i>g</i> = 1
  + <i>e</i> - <i>v</i>. See the link for "density" on the search page.
</p>

<h2>Tiling data</h2>

<p>
  Data for tilings are for the so-called "natural" tilings (reference [2]
  and [13]).  The D-symbols are what were originally called "Delaney"
  symbols by Dress and "Delaney-Dress" symbols by subsequent workers. The
  economical one-line encoding is due to Delgado-Friedrichs so "D-symbol"
  seems appropriate. The size of the D-symbol is what is known as "flag
  transitivity" to mathematicians. One may use the search to find the only
  regular tiling (D-symbol size = 1) and all natural tilings with size up to
  4. Regular <i>nets</i> are defined independently of tilings but are the
  only structures with natural tilings that have one kind of vertex, edge,
  face and tile (transitivity 1111 - see reference [2]).
</p>

<h2>Layers and polyhedra</h2>

<p>
  <i>Layers</i> are three dimensional 2-periodic structures and their
  symmetries are layer groups. Strictly 2-dimensional 2-periodic structures
  have symmetries that are plane groups.  Structures that are not
  2-dimensional have the keyword "layer" We give also a 3-dimensional space
  group which can be used for entering the structure in a crystal-drawing
  program such as CrystalMaker. Where possible, coordinates are given for
  unit edge length.
</p>

<p>
  Notice that for 2-dimensional structures, vertex symbols denote the
  polygons meeting at that vertex in cyclic order (compare 3^3.4^2 and
  3^2.4.3.4); for layers vertex symbols are the same as for nets.
</p>

<p>
  See reference [12] below for an account of plane nets in crystal
  chemistry. For nets named OKHnn, nn is the net number of that
  work.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Polyhedra</i> are 0-periodic, but of course 3-dimensional.  We use the
  term to include generalized polyhedra ("cages") such as the adamantane
  cage (see <b>ada</b>). The coordinates of the vertices are cartesian
  coordinates but can be used with the given space group to again draw as if
  it were part of a crystal structure. To do this set the unit cell of the
  given space group to <i>d d d</i> 90.0 90.0 90.0 with <i>d</i> some
  convenient number (say 10.0) and divide the given coordinates by <i>d</i>
  and use them as crystal coordinates. One will then get the polyhedron
  centered on 0, 0, 0.
</p>

<p>
  Notice that for polyhedra with non-crystallographic symmetries more than
  one set of coordinates may be given for a single vertex type - see
  e.g. <b>dod</b> with icosahedral symmetry but described with <i>m</i>-3
  symmetry - the single vertex type splits into V1a and V1b.  Hexagonal
  polyhedra are described using an orthorhombic space group - see
  e.g. <b>hxb</b>. A square antiprism is another example of a polyhedron
  with non-crystallographic symmetry - see <b>sap</b>.
</p>

<p>
  For convenience the coordinates of the centers of faces are also
  given.
</p>

<p>
  In the strict definition adopted by many mathematicians
  <i>polyhedra</i> have a planar 3-connected graph and can be realized as a
  strictly convex solid. We refer to structures that do not have this
  property as <i>cages</i> for the purpose of the database (generally
  elsewhere the term "cage" includes polyhedra as in "sodalite cage" or
  "faujasite cage", but these structures are polyhedra <i>sensu
    stricto</i>).
</p>

<p>
  Notice that generally we give vertices for equal edge; some polyhedra do
  not then have planar faces (see e.g. the faujasite cage
  <b>fac</b> which is given as it appears in the crystal structure). For
  <i>Archimedean</i> polyhedra (one kind of vertex) and the full symmetry
  the requirement of equal edges uniquely defines the embedding; for their
  duals (<i>Catalan</i> polyhedra with one kind of face) there are generally
  more degrees of freedom and there appears to be no definitive embedding
  agreed upon - the most pleasing have unequal edges. [Exceptions
  are <b>rdo</b> and <b>trc</b> which are the duals of the two quasiregular
  (one kind of edge) Archimedean polyhedra <b>cbo</b> and <b>ido</b>]
</p>

<p>
  <i>Simple</i> polyhedra have exactly three faces meeting at a
  vertex; <i>simplicial</i> polyhedra have all triangular faces. The dual of
  a simple polyhedron is simplicial and <i>vice versa</i>.
